## How to use our model in Azure
Azure Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning. You can do training, validation and deployment of any machine learning model in Azure. 


-  Training in the Cloud
    - 1: Insert credentials in config.json (Create a workspace before in AzureMl)
    - 2: Create a compute target and an environment (I created a Python env containing the env.txt script)
    - 3: run src/data/upload-data.py // This will upload the data to Azure as json files 
    - 4: Create a compute target (I used coompute clusters under compute in Azure Ml)
    - 5: run src/models/azure/train_azure.py - Remember to update the name of your compute Target and Environment // This will start an expriment run

- Deploying to the cloud
    - 6: After the training run is complete, find the runId and insert that into src/models/azure/register_model.py
    - 7: Now run deploy.py, and insert your own environment name. 
    - 8: You now have a running model deployed at port 6789
    - 9: Run this from your Terminal to test: curl -X POST -d '{"this":"is a test"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:6789/score

## OPTUNA 
Optuna is used to do opimization of hyperparameters. 
A method is added
